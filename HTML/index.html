            <p>
                This website will act as my personal portfolio containing links
                to the various projects I have worked on! It as a landing page 
                I created for the primary purpose of getting a <strong><em>JOB</em></strong>!
            </p>
            
            <p>
                I will continue to update this page with future projects I work on
                with the secondary purpose being tracking my progress as a software dev!
