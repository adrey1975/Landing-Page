        I’m an English major who has decided to learn how to code! Prior to my coding endeavor, 
        I had the privilege of being a founding teacher at a local middle school. Teaching in the 
        midst of covid was no easy task, but regardless of how stressful it was at times, I really 
        enjoyed teaching and I did that for a year before I decided I wanted to transition into a 
        career in tech. I’ve been learning Python and C++ for the past 8 months, and currently I've 
        been diving into JavaScript and Kotlin as well. I’m trying to also pick up a few libraries 
        and frameworks. I have experience working with IDE’s and text editors such as Visual Studio, 
        Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, IDLE, and Dev C++. I have a portfolio that consists of a 
        handful of simple programs I've developed using both Python and C++. Currently working on my 
        first crud web application using Flask.
