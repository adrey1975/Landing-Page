            I'm a former English teacher turned software developer. Prior to my coding endeavor 
            I had the privilege of being a founding teacher at a local middle school in Austin, TX.
            Teaching was a rewarding and fun experience, but deep down I always knew I wanted to work in tech. 
            I started researching efficient ways of learning how to code, but I quickly realized this wasn't going to
            happen overnight as nothing worthwhile ever does, so it was best I just get started! I decided to buy a project based book on Python. 
            I was immediately hooked! I signed up for some online classes at my local community college and I started coding by night,
            while teaching 5th graders how to write a proper essay by day! Over the past 8 months I've taken a Python 
            and C++ course, all while teaching myself HTML and CSS on the side. Moving forward I'll be learning
            JavaScript and Node.JS via The Odin Project, while I build my portfolio and try to land a job.
