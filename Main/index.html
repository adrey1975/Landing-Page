                    This website is my personal portfolio containing links
                    to the various projects I have worked on! It serves as a landing page 
                    I created for the primary purpose of getting a <strong><em>JOB</em></strong>!

                <p>
                    I will continue to update this page with any future projects I work on
                    with the secondary purpose being tracking my progress as a software dev!
                    Click the about link on the top right to get to know a bit about me, or click 
                    the email link if you want to hire me :-) hehe
